# ðŸ’§ Water Intake Tracker (React App)

A simple and clean React-based web app that helps users track their daily water intake and hydration habits.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Set your own daily water goal (default: 2000 ml)
- âœ… Log water intake with custom value or quick-add buttons (250ml / 500ml)
- âœ… View daily progress with percentage and progress bar
- âœ… See hydration history of past days
- âœ… Data persists using `localStorage`

## ðŸ§  Problem-Solving Approach

1. Used React hooks for state management.
2. Saved data in `localStorage` for persistence.
3. Focused on clean UI and user-friendly layout.


## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Feedback with Colored Progress Bar

To make hydration tracking more intuitive, the app uses color-coded progress bars:

| Intake Status         | Color      |
|------------------------|------------|
| Below daily goal       | ðŸ”µ Blue     |
| Goal reached exactly   | âœ… Green    |
| Goal exceeded          | ðŸ”´ Red      |

This helps users immediately recognize their progress throughout the day.

```js
// JS logic for color selection
if (progressPercentage < 100) {
  progressColor = 'under-goal';     // Blue
} else if (progressPercentage === 100) {
  progressColor = 'met-goal';       // Green
} else {
  progressColor = 'over-goal';      // Red
}

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run the App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grishma-shrimali/water-tracker.git
cd water-tracker
npm install
npm start
